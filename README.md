üöÄ Web To-Do Manager (Multi-User, Deployed)
This is a complete, production-ready web application built to demonstrate full-stack development capability, security practices, and cloud deployment mastery.

Key Features Demonstrated:
Multi-User Authentication: Secure email/password login using Firebase Authentication.

Persistent Storage: Data is stored in a Firestore database, ensuring tasks are isolated and secure for each user.

API Security: Flask endpoints are protected using a custom @token_required decorator that verifies Firebase ID tokens, preventing unauthorized data access.

Deployment: The application is containerized using Docker and deployed live on Google Cloud Run.

For detailed setup, file structure, and technical explanations, please see the dedicated README in the web-todo-app directory.
